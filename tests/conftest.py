#
# The conftest.py file serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire directory.
# Fixtures defined in a conftest.py can be used by any test in that package without
# needing to import them (pytest will automatically discover them).
#
# IMPORTANT:
# fixtures with autouse=True are always run when tests are run.
# Other fixtures needs to explicitly mentioned in the arguments of the test.
